## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:(在项目目录中，可以运行:)

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.(在开发模式下运行app)<br />

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.(如果进行编辑，页面将重新加载。)<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.(您还将在控制台中看到任何lint错误)

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.(以交互监视模式启动测试运行程序)<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
(它在生产模式下正确地绑定了React并优化构建以获得最佳性能。)

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
(如果您对构建工具和配置选项不满意，您可以随时“eject”。此命令将从项目中删除单个构建依赖项。)

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.
(相反，它会将所有的配置文件和传递依赖项(webpack、Babel、ESLint等)直接复制到您的项目中，这样您就可以完全控制它们。除了' eject '之外，所有的命令都可以工作，但是它们会指向复制的脚本，这样你就可以调整它们了。在这一点上，你只能靠自己了。)

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
(你不需要使用' eject '。所策划的特性集适合小型和中型部署，您不应该觉得有义务使用此特性。但是我们知道，如果您不能在准备好时对其进行自定义，则此工具将毫无用处。)
